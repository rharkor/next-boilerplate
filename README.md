## 🎯 Getting Started

_If you want to use the dev container, please follow the [container stack](#-container-stack) instructions._

To get started with this boilerplate, follow these steps:

1. Fork & clone repository:

```bash
## Don't forget to ⭐ star and fork it first :)
git clone https://github.com/rharkor/next-boilerplate
```

2. Initialize the project:

```bash
npm run init
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## 🗄️ Monorepo packages

This boilerplate uses [npm workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/workspaces) to manage multiple packages in one repository.
The following packages are available:

- `packages/app`: The main application
- `packages/docs`: The documentation website
- `packages/landing`: The landing page
- `packages/scripts`: Scripts to help you manage your project

To run a script in a package, you can use the following command:

```bash
npm run <script> --workspace=<package>
```

For example, to run the `dev` script in the `app` package, you can use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev --workspace=app
```

Each package has its own `package.json` file, so you can add dependencies specific to a package.

Please make sure to add the dependencies to the `package.json` file of the package you want to use them in.
For example, if you want to add a dependency to the `app` package, you should add it to the `app/package.json` file with the following command:

```bash
npm install <package> --workspace=packages/app
```

or

```bash
cd app
npm install <package>
```

> If you install a dependency in the root `package.json` file, it will be available in all packages and in most cases, you don't want that.

Port for each package:

- **App**: `3000`
- **Docs**: `3001`
- **Landing**: `3002`

## 🚀 Deployment

Easily deploy your Next.js app with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new) by clicking the button below:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Frharkor%2Fnext-boilerplate&env=REDIS_USE_TLS,AUTH_ADMIN_EMAIL,AUTH_ADMIN_PASSWORD,GITHUB_CLIENT_ID,GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET,NEXTAUTH_SECRET,PASSWORD_HASHER_SECRET&envDescription=Keys%20needed%20to%20start%20the%20application%2C%20please%20see%20other%20env%20required%20like%20database%20and%20redis&envLink=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Frharkor%2Fnext-boilerplate%2Fblob%2Fmain%2F.env.example)

## 📃 Scripts Overview

The following scripts are available in the `package.json`:

- `init`: Initializes the project by setting up your information
- `dev`: Starts the development server (only the main application package)
- `build`: Builds the app for production
- `start`: Starts the production server
- `lint`: Lints the code using ESLint
- `lint:fix`: Automatically fixes linting errors
- `prettier`: Checks the code for proper formatting
- `prettier:fix`: Automatically fixes formatting issues
- `test`: Runs unit and integration tests
- `preinstall`: Ensures the project is installed with Npm
- `depcheck`: Checks for unused dependencies

## 🐳 Container Stack

The boilerplate comes with a pre-configured Docker container stack and a dev container. The stack includes the following services:

- **Next.js** - A React framework for building fast and scalable web applications
- **DocuSaurus** - A modern static website generator (for documentation)
- **PostgreSQL** - A powerful, open-source relational database system
- **Redis** - An in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache, and message broker

To start the development container in vsCode [see](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_quick-start-open-an-existing-folder-in-a-container).

Ports:

- Next.js: 3000
- Docs: 3001
- Landing: 3002
- PostgreSQL: 5432
- Redis: 6379
- Desktop (password: vscode): 6080

## 🧪 Testing

This boilerplate comes with various testing setups to ensure your application's reliability and robustness.

### Running Tests

- **Unit and integration tests**: Run Jest tests using `npm run test`

### Tanstack query

[Tanstack query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) is a powerful, fast, and lightweight data fetching and caching library. It provides a concise, declarative API for fetching data that integrates seamlessly with React.

## 💻 Environment Variables handling

[T3 Env](https://env.t3.gg/) is a library that provides environmental variables checking at build time, type validation and transforming. It ensures that your application is using the correct environment variables and their values are of the expected type. You’ll never again struggle with runtime errors caused by incorrect environment variable usage.

Config file is located at `env.mjs`. Simply set your client and server variables and import `env` from any file in your project.

```ts
export const env = createEnv({
  server: {
    // Server variables
    SECRET_KEY: z.string(),
  },
  client: {
    // Client variables
    API_URL: z.string().url(),
  },
  runtimeEnv: {
    // Assign runtime variables
    SECRET_KEY: process.env.SECRET_KEY,
    API_URL: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL,
  },
})
```

If the required environment variables are not set, you'll get an error message:

```sh
  ❌ Invalid environment variables: { SECRET_KEY: [ 'Required' ] }
```
