# Create Next App

The easiest way to get started with Next.js is by using `create-next-app`. This CLI tool enables you to quickly start building a new Next.js application, with everything set up for you. You can create a new app using the default Next.js template, or by using one of the [official Next.js examples](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples). To get started, use the following command:

### Interactive

You can create a new project interactively by running:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
# or
yarn create next-app
# or
pnpm create next-app
# or
bunx create-next-app
```

You will be asked for the name of your project, and then whether you want to
create a TypeScript project:

```bash
✔ Would you like to use TypeScript? … No / Yes
```

Select **Yes** to install the necessary types/dependencies and create a new TS project.

### Non-interactive

You can also pass command line arguments to set up a new project
non-interactively. See `create-next-app --help`:

```bash
Usage: create-next-app <project-directory> [options]

Options:
  -V, --version                        output the version number

  -h, --help                           display help for command
```

- **Interactive website**: Running `npx @next-boilerplate/cli@latest` launches an interactive website that guides you through the process of creating your new project.
- **Support for custom plugins**: Next boilerplate cli allows you to use your custom plugins to match your needs.
